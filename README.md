# Final-Year-Project
** Addressing Class Imbalance in Credit Default Prediction with Effective Machine Learning Strategies **
This is my final year project for my Statistical Data Science degree course. Please advise me and offer your guidance.
Addressing Class Imbalance in Credit Default Prediction
with Effective Machine Learning Strategies
Aimed to provide insights and recommendations for credit risk
assessment in the banking industry.
Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation.
Improved recall scores by 250%, from 20% to 70%, through a
combination of techniques, including class weight adjustment,
resampling methods, and stacking multiple models such as Random
Forest and AdaBoost.
Developed a formula to improve model performance in classimbalanced datasets by estimating optimal class weight adjustment
based on minority class proportion.
