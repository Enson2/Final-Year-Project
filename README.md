## **Addressing Class Imbalance in Credit Default Prediction with Effective Machine Learning Strategies**

- Aimed to provide insights and recommendations for credit risk assessment in the banking industry.

- Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation.

- Significantly improved the ability to detect credit defaults by 250%, from 20% to 70%, using machine learning techniques such as adjusting class weights, resampling methods, and stacking models such as Random Forest and AdaBoost.

- Developed a formula to improve model performance in class-imbalanced datasets by estimating optimal class weight adjustment based on minority class proportion.
